# Webpage
Starting point
This is my first project to start off with Web-Developement.
I will turn it into a website containing many topics such as recipes, animes, mangas and forth.

This website will only be made with HTML and styled with CSS, so it may look extremely bland
All of this is something i learnt from the Odin project, now i'm putting it to work.
