# Webpage
Starting point
<p>This is my first project to start off with Web-Developement.</p>
<p>I will turn it into a website containing many topics such as recipes, animes, mangas and forth.</p>

<p>This website will only be made with HTML and styled with CSS, so it may look extremely bland</p>
<p>All of this is something i learnt from the Odin project, now i'm putting it to work.</p>
